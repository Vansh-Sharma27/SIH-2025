## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

We use Git Flow for our branching strategy:

```
main (production)
â”œâ”€â”€ develop (main development)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ feature/your-feature-name
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bugfix/issue-description
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hotfix/critical-fix
```

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your local develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# ...

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Style Guidelines

### Dart/Flutter Style Guide

We follow the official [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style) and [Flutter Style Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets-intro#basic-widgets).

Key points:
- Use `dartfmt` to format your code
- Maximum line length: 80 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Write tests for new features

### Code Organization

```dart
// Good example
class BusTracker {
  // Constants first
  static const int updateInterval = 30;
  
  // Private fields
  final String _busId;
  Timer? _updateTimer;
  
  // Public fields
  late final LocationService locationService;
  
  // Constructor
  BusTracker(this._busId);
  
  // Public methods
  void startTracking() {
    // Implementation
  }
  
  // Private methods
  void _updateLocation() {
    // Implementation
  }
  
  // Dispose method last
  void dispose() {
    _updateTimer?.cancel();
  }
}
```

## Commit Guidelines
